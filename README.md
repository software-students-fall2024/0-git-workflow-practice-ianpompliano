## Interesting Article

I found this cool [article](https://henrikwarne.com/2014/06/30/what-makes-a-good-programmer/) called "What Makes a Good Programmer."

## Why Itâ€™s Interesting

I think this article is interesting because it emphasizes the important skills on a high-level that don't necessarily include specific programming languages or technical skills. The focus on problem dissection and consistency are things I have experienced in my time as a programmer. I also thought the discussion of continuous learning is something that is very relevant in this field.


Marko Todorovic:

I think this article is interesting as well. The continous learning point is especially important because of the complexity of programming and its continous changes throughout the years. At a high level of programming, the hardest part of writing code isn't the specific language but the problem solving and the understanding of the complex ideas.

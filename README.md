## Interesting Article

I found this cool [article](https://henrikwarne.com/2014/06/30/what-makes-a-good-programmer/) called "What Makes a Good Programmer."

## Why It’s Interesting

I think this article is interesting because it emphasizes the important skills on a high-level that don't necessarily include specific programming languages or technical skills. The focus on problem dissection and consistency are things I have experienced in my time as a programmer. I also thought the discussion of continuous learning is something that is very relevant in this field.
